# 🂡 Chuchila Scoreboard

Welcome to the Chuchila Scoreboard App — a fun weekend project I built to track our scores while playing a classic card game with friends. This game is more than just cards — it’s what we do while hanging out, catching up on life, having a sip of beer,  and talking about everything going on in the world.

## What is Chuchila?

**Chuchila** is a traditional card game we play using a standard 52-card deck. Each player is dealt 13 cards, and the objective is to create **four valid groups** (sets or sequences) from your hand.

- The player with the strongest groupings earns the most points in that round.
- It combines **luck** and **strategy**, and no two games feel the same.

### 🃏 Basic Rules:

1. Each player is dealt 13 cards.
2. Players aim to divide their cards into 4 valid groups (either runs or sets).
3. Points are awarded based on the strength and validity of those groups.
4. A round ends when players reveal their hands and score is updated.
5. First player to reach **20 points** wins!

### 🃏 Extra Rules: (BETTER)
  
This is our made up rules so, if you have 6 pairs you get 6 points.
If you have four of a kind, you get 4 points except four ACES, that gives you 5 points. 
If you win all 4 round in one particular game, Thats SALAMI, and you get 5 points for that round. 
If all 4 of you wins each hand in a round, that is a BETTER for next round.

And, everytime these extra rules comes in, the immediate next round is called "The BETTER"
Everything is same in BETTER, except you get 2 points instead of 1 for each win.
